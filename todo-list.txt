Make the "Book club" link go to a page describing the book club, instead of immediately downloading the guide.
Then on the book club page there could be a download link.

Each option on the navbar should lead to a new page. Some still need content filled in. (ourmission, whatwebelieve)


Google map embed on "meetingtimes.html" is not yet responsive.








Final steps:

One final time, copy the top and bottom of the index page and paste it into all other pages.
(Basically, only ever make changes to these areas on "index.html", then use that as a base.)

Go through EACH page--make sure nav links for active page are listed appropriately.
