Make the "Book club" link go to a page describing the book club, instead of immediately downloading the guide.
Then on the book club page there could be a download link.

Each option on the navbar should lead to a new page. Some still need content filled in.

fix main page image getting giant on small view ports (set to smaller col, then regular col on higher sizes?)


The underline tries to show up on the main icon when hovering (like a link). Get rid of that. (but maybe have the color slightly darken, like the navbar)

Google map embed on "meetingtimes.html" is not yet responsive.








Final steps:

One final time, copy the top and bottom of the index page and paste it into all other pages.
(Basically, only ever make changes to these areas on "index.html", then use that as a base.)

Go through EACH page--make sure nav links for active page are listed appropriately.
