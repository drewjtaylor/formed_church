# "Formed Church" Website
## Author: Andrew Taylor

The goal of this project is to create a website for a new church I'm a part of.

Although it won't be exactly the same, I would like to emulate a lot of functionality and features from [this example](http://www.bldg28.com/)



### About placeholders

Currently I do not have a lot of actual content that will be for the actual site when it's done. In the meantime, I'm using placeholder images from the Instagram site of the church-planter, as well as some pictures of his famiy from the orginization that sponsors him: Assist Church Expansion.

### Home page

The home page greets visitors with a jumbotron at the top with the church name and logo (currently a placeholder created using font-awesome icons).

Under the jumbotron is a navbar that sticks to the top of the viewport as the user scrolls down. The navbar items are sorted by categories, and create drop-down menus when clicked. When it's complete, the site should have a page or link for each item in the navbar.

The content of the home page includes a carousel slide-show that will show pictures from the church, as well as brief blurbs about the church.
